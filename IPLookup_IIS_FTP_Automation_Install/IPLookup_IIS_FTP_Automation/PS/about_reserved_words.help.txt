    Reserved words

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Words in the Windows PowerShell that have special meaning and 
    therefore cannot be used as identifiers

LONG DESCRIPTION
    There are certain words that have special meaning in PowerShell. When 
    these terms appear outside quotation marks, PowerShell attempts to apply 
    their special meaning rather than just treat them as character strings. If 
    you want to use these terms as parameter arguments in a command or 
    script, that is, not invoke their special meaning, enclose the reserved 
    word in quotation marks.

    The following are the reserved words in PowerShell:

    LANGUAGE STATEMENTS
    break       continue     do           for
    foreach     while        if           switch
    until       where        function     filter

    STATEMENT SYNTAX
    else     elseif     in     return

SEE ALSO
    For information about command syntax, enter the following command at 
    the PowerShell command prompt:

        help about_command_syntax

        help about_script_block

    For information about how PowerShell parses a command, enter the following 
    command:

    For information about language statements, such as foreach, if, 
        for, and while, follow the prefix, "about_" with the name of the 
        statement. For example, to read about the foreach statement, enter 
        the following command:

        help about_foreach

    For information about the filter statement or the return statement 
    syntax, enter the following command:

        help about_function

    You can find information about statement syntax in the language 
    statements that use them. For example, for information about else and 
    elseif language syntax, enter the following command:

        help about_if
