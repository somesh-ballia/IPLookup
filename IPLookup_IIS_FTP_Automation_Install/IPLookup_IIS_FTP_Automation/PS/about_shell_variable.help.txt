    Shell variables

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Variables that are created and declared by Windows PowerShell 

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Shell variables are a set of variables that are created and declared 
    by Windows PowerShell and appear by default in every Windows PowerShell
    session. The variables are maintained throughout the session and are
    available to all commands, scripts, and applications that run in that
    session.

    Windows PowerShell supports two types of shell variables: 

    -- Automatic variables: Store the state of Windows PowerShell. These
       variables are maintained by the system and changed dynamically. Users
       cannot (and should not) change the value of these variables. For
       example, the $PID variable stores the process ID of the current
       PowerShell.exe process.

    -- Preference variables: Store user preferences for Windows PowerShell.
       These variables are created by Windows PowerShell and populated with
       default values. Users can change the values of these variables. For
       example, MaximumHistoryCount determines the maximum number of entries
       in the session history.

    You can use shell variables as you would any other type of variable. 
    For example, you can use the $pshome shell variable, which stores the
    path to the Windows PowerShell installation directory, as the value
    of the Path variable in a Get-Childitem command. For example:

        get-childitem -path $pshome
