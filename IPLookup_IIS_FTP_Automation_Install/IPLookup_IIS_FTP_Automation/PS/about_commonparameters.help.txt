    Common Parameters

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Parameters that every cmdlet supports.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Windows PowerShell includes several common parameters that all
    cmdlets support. This feature provides a consistent interface to
    Windows PowerShell.

    When a cmdlet supports a common parameter, the use of the parameter
    does not cause an error. However, the parameter might not have any 
    effect in some cmdlets.

    The common parameters are:

    Parameter      Description
    ---------      --------------------------------------------------
     
    Verbose        Boolean. Generates detailed information about the 
                   operation, much like tracing or a transaction log.
                   This parameter is effective only in cmdlets that
		   generate verbose data.

    Debug          Boolean. Generates programmer-level detail about the
                   operation. This parameter is effective only in cmdlets
                   that generate debug data.

    ErrorAction    Enum. Determines how the cmdlet responds when an error
                   occurs. Values are: Continue [default], Stop, 
                   SilentlyContinue, Inquire.

    ErrorVariable  String. Specifies a variable that stores errors from 
                   the command during processing. This variable is 
                   populated in addition to $error.

    OutVariable    String. Specifies a variable that stores output from
                   the command during processing.

    OutBuffer      Int32. Determines the number of objects to buffer
                   before calling the next cmdlet in the pipeline. 


    In addition to the common parameters, there are two parameters that
    cmdlets support if they change the system state.

    Parameter     Description
    ---------     -------------------------------------------------------

    WhatIf        Boolean. Explains what will happen if the command is 
                  executed, without actually executing the command.

    Confirm       Boolean. Prompts the user for permission before 
                  performing any action that modifies the system.
