You must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer to run scripts and executables. As a security best practice, log on to your computer by using an account that is not in the Administrators group, and then use the runas command to run your script or executable as an administrator. At a command prompt, type runas /profile /User:MyComputer\Administratorcmd to open a command window with administrator rights and then type cscript.exeScriptName (include the script's full path and any parameters).
