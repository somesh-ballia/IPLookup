    Redirection

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Redirecting output from the Windows PowerShell to text files

LONG DESCRIPTION
    By default, PowerShell directs command output to the screen in the 
    PowerShell. However, you can override this behavior by directing the 
    output to a text file, which allows you to capture the results for 
    later use.

    To write the results of a command to a text file, you must add the 
    greater than (>) symbol and the file name to the end of your command. 
    For example, the following command writes the results from a Get-
    ChildItem command to a text file:

        Get-ChildItem c:\windows\system > c:\techdocs\results.txt

    When you run this command, the output is sent to the results.txt file 
    in the c:\techdocs directory, and no output is displayed on the screen. 
    If the specified file does not exist, the file is created and the 
    output is written to that file. If the file already exists, the output 
    replaces any existing content in the file with new content.

    If you do not want to replace the content of an existing output file, 
    you can append the output to the existing content by using two greater 
    than (>>) symbols, as shown in the following example:

        Get-ChildItem c:\windows\system >> c:\techdocs\results.txt

    The command appends the new output after any existing content, and none 
    of the existing content is deleted.
