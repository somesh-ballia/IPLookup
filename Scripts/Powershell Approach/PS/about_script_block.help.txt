    Script blocks

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Grouping statements and commands into a single block of code in the 
    Windows PowerShell 

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The following are a few script block samples:
    
    This example loops through each file with the *.txt extension then writes 
    its full name and length to the host.

        foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem c:\techdocs\*.txt)
        {
            Write-Host $file.fullname $file.length
        }

    This example nests an if statement inside a foreach loop.

        foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem c:\techdocs\*.txt)
        {
            if ($file.length -ge 100)
            {
                Write-Host $file.name - $file.length bytes
            }
            else
            {
                Write-Host $file.name - "The file is smaller than 100 bytes."
            }
        }


ASSIGNING SCRIPT BLOCKS TO VARIABLES
    You can also assign script blocks to variables as follows:

        $a = {Write-Host $file.fullname $file.length}

    Use the & to execute the script block variables as follows:


        foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem c:\techdocs\*.txt) {&$a}

        Write-Host $file.fullname $file.length


FUNCTIONS AND FILTERS

        function text_files
        {
            Get-ChildItem c:\techdocs\*.txt
        }
