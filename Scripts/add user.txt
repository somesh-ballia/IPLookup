The following example shows the syntax of the net user command:

net user [username [password | *] [options]] [/domain]
         username {password | *} /add [options] [/domain]
         username [/delete] [/domain]
				

You can use the net user command to create and modify user accounts on computers. When you use this command without command-line switches, the user accounts for the computer are listed. The user account information is stored in the user accounts database. This command works only on servers.

You can use the following parameters with the net user command:

    username
    Is the name of the user account you want to add, delete, modify, or view. The name of the user account can have as many as 20 characters.
    password
    Assigns or changes a password for the user's account. A password must satisfy the minimum length set with the /minpwlen option of the net accounts command. It can contain as many as 14 characters.
    *
    Produces a prompt for the password. The password is not displayed when you type it at a password prompt.
    /domain
    Performs the operation on the primary domain controller (PDC) of the current domain. This parameter applies only to computers running Windows NT Workstation that are members of a Windows NT Server domain. By default, Windows NT Server-based computers perform operations on the PDC.
    /add
    Adds a user account to the user accounts database.
    /delete
    Removes a user account from the user accounts database.
