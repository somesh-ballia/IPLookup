    Working location

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Accessing items from the working location in the Windows PowerShell

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The current working location is the default location that commands 
    point to. In other words, this is the location that PowerShell uses if 
    you do not supply an explicit path to the item or location being affected 
    by the command. In most cases, the current working location will be a 
    drive accessed through the FileSystem PowerShell Provider and, in 
    some cases, a directory on that drive. For example, you might set your 
    current working location as c:\program files\Windows PowerShell. 
    As a result, all commands are processed from this location unless 
    another path is explicitly provided.

    PowerShell maintains the current working location for each drive even when 
    the drive is not the current drive. This allows you to access items from 
    the current working location by referring only to the drive of another 
    location. For example, suppose that your current working location is 
    c:\windows. Now suppose you use the following command to change your 
    current working location to the hklm: drive:

        Set-Location hklm:

    Although your current location is now the registry drive, you can still 
    access items in the c:\windows directory simply by using the C drive, 
    as shown in the following example:

        Get-ChildItem c:

    PowerShell remembers that your current working location for that drive is 
    the Windows directory so it retrieves items from that directory. The 
    results would be the same as specifying Get-ChildItem c:\windows.

    In PowerShell, you can use the Get-Location command to determine the 
    current working location, and you can use the Set-Location command to set 
    the current working location. For example, the following command sets the 
    current working location to the Windows directory of the C drive:

    Set-Location c:\windows

    Once you set the current working location, you can still access items 
    from other drives simply by including the drive name (followed by a 
    colon) in the command, as shown in the following example:

        Get-ChildItem hklm:\software

    The command retrieves a list of items in the Software container of the 
    HKEY Local Machine hive in the Registry.

    PowerShell also allows you to use special characters to represent the 
    current working location and its parent location. To represent the current 
    working location, use a single period. To represent the parent of the 
    current working location, use two periods. For example, the following 
    specifies a subdirectory named system in the current working 
    location:

        Get-ChildItem .\system

    If the current working location is c:\windows, then this command 
    returns a list of all the items in c:\windows\system. However, if you 
    use a double period, the parent directory of the current working 
    directory is used, as shown in the following example:

        Get-ChildItem ..\"program files"

    In this case, PowerShell treats the double periods as the C drive, so the 
    command retrieves all items in c:\program files.

    A path beginning with a slash identifies a path from the root of the 
    current drive. For example, if your current working location is 
    c:\program files\Windows PowerShell, the root of your drive is C. 
    As a result, the following command lists all items in the c:\windows 
    directory:

        Get-ChildItem \windows

    If you do not specify a path beginning with a drive name, slash, or 
    period when supplying the name of a container or item, then the 
    container or item is assumed to be located in the current working 
    location. For example, if your current working location is c:\windows, 
    the following command will return all items in the c:\windows\system 
    directory:

        Get-ChildItem system

    If you were to specify a filename rather than a directory name, PowerShell 
    would return details about that file, assuming that file was located in 
    the current working location.
