SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Immediately return to top of a program loop

LONG DESCRIPTION

    In a script, the continue statement causes program 
    flow to move immediately to the top of the innermost loop controlled by 
    any of these statements:
    
    *    for
    *    foreach
    *    while
    
    EXAMPLE
    
    In this example, program flow returns to the top of the while loop if 
    $ctr is equal to 5. The result is that all numbers between 1 and 10 
    except 5 are displayed.
    
    while ($ctr -lt 10)
         {
           $ctr +=1 
           if ($ctr -eq 5) {continue}
           Write-Host $ctr
         }
    
    Note that in a for loop, execution continues at the first line in the 
    loop. If the arguments of the for statement test a value that is 
    modified by the for statement, an infinite loop can result.
