    Command history

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Retrieving commands entered at the Windows PowerShell command 
    prompt

LONG DESCRIPTION
    When you enter a command at the command prompt, PowerShell maintains a 
    record of that command so that you can reuse it. That record is added to 
    the command history, which is maintained until you exit the PowerShell.

    By default, PowerShell stores only 64 commands in the command history. If 
    you exceed this number of commands in a single session, PowerShell 
    maintains the most recent 64 commands. You can override the default number 
    of commands by setting the $MaximumHistoryCount variable to a specified 
    number. For example, the following command changes the command history 
    retention to 100 commands:

        $MaximumHistoryCount = 100

    When you set the $MaximumHistoryCount variable at the PowerShell command 
    prompt, the change is in effect until you exit PowerShell. If you want the 
    new variable value to be set as the default value for all of your 
    PowerShell sessions, you should add the above command to the profile.ps1 
    file. The profile.ps1 file for the currently logged-on user is located at 
    the following file system location: $home\"my documents"\PSConfiguration. 
    After you add the command, be sure to save the profile.ps1 file and 
    restart PowerShell.

    Once commands have been saved to the command history, you can take any 
    of the following steps to access one of those commands:

    * Press the Up Arrow key to move backwards through the command history. 
    The first time you press the Up Arrow key, PowerShell displays the last 
    command that you ran in the current session. If you press the Up Arrow 
    key again, the next-to-last command is displayed, and so on. Once 
    you've located the command you're looking for, edit it as necessary and 
    then press Enter.

    * Press the Down Arrow key to move forward through the command history. 
    The first time you press the Down Arrow key, PowerShell display the first 
    command that you ran in the current session. If you press the Down 
    Arrow key again, the second command is displayed, and so on. Once 
    you've located the command you're looking for, edit it as necessary and 
    then press Enter.

    * Type one or more characters and then press F8 to display the last 
    entered command that begins with those characters. If you press F8 
    again, PowerShell displays the second-to-last matching command, and so on. 
    Once you've located the command you're looking for, edit it as 
    necessary and then press Enter.

    * Press F7 to display the command history. Use the Up Arrow and Down 
    Arrow keys to scroll to the desired command. Once you've located the 
    command you're looking for, press Enter to run the command.

    * Press F7 to display the command history. To run one of the commands, 
    press F9, type the number assigned to the command, as it appears in the 
    list, and then press Enter to display the command at the command 
    prompt. Edit the command as necessary, and then press Enter again to 
    run the command.

    In addition to taking one of these steps to run a command from the 
    command history, you can also view a list of previous commands by using 
    of the Get-History Cmdlets, as shown in the following example:

        Get-History

    The command returns a list of the last 32 commands that you entered. 
    You can also use the Get-History Cmdlet to retrieve a specific command 
    by the number assigned to the command. (A number is assigned to each 
    command in the order in which the command is entered.) For example, to 
    retrieve the 12th command that you ran, enter the following command at 
    the PowerShell command prompt:

        Get-History -id 12

    Note that, by default, PowerShell assigns the alias "history" to the Get-
    History Cmdlet.

    PowerShell also provides the Invoke-History Cmdlet to run a command in the 
    command history. To use this Cmdlet, you must know the number of the 
    command, which usually means first using the Get-History Cmdlet and 
    then using the Invoke-History Cmdlet. For example, to run the 12th 
    command in the command history, enter the following command:

        Invoke-History -id 12

    This will run the original command as though you had entered it 
    directly at the command prompt.

SEE ALSO
    For information about history-related Cmdlets, use the help alias (for 
    the Get-Help Cmdlet) plus the Cmdlet name. For example, to view 
    information about the Get-History Cmdlet, enter the following command 
    at the PowerShell command prompt:

        help Get-History

    For information about command line editing, enter the following 
    command:

        help about_line_editing

    For information about automatic variables, enter the following command:

        help about_automatic_variables
