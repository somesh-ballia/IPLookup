SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Windows PowerShell core Cmdlets related to data stores

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell core Cmdlets are a set of predefined Cmdlets that provide a 
    consistent user experience when accessing different data stores through 
    PowerShell Providers. For example, you can use the 
    Get-ChildItem Cmdlet whether you're accessing the Windows file system or 
    the Windows Registry. The PowerShell Providers facilitate your 
    connection to the data stores and allow you to use the Get-ChildItem and 
    other core Cmdlets in a consistent manner for each data store.

    PowerShell provides the following core Cmdlets, which are listed by 
    the Cmdlet nouns:
