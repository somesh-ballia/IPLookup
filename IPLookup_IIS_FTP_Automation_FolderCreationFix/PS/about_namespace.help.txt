    Namespaces

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Namespaces maintained by the Windows PowerShell 

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Namespaces in PowerShell support a system for uniquely identifying items 
    in the data stores accessed through the PowerShell Providers. 
    Namespaces, which are maintained as part of the PowerShell system state, 
    ensure that each entity is assigned an unambiguous label that 
    identifies that entity and no other.

    PowerShell supports a number of different namespaces that correspond to 
    the PowerShell Providers. For example, PowerShell maintains a 
    namespace for the FileSystem provider. The FileSystem namespace, like 
    the FileSystem provider, is associated with multiple PowerShell drives 
    that correspond to the drives on your system. All items available through 
    the FileSystem provider (the files and directories on your computer) are 
    accessible through that namespace. For instance, the shell.dll file in the 
    c:\windows\system32 directory is part of the FileSystem namespace, as 
    shown in the following fully qualified path name:

        filesystem::c:\windows\system32\shell.dll

    Note that this is an example of a fully qualified path name. It is not 
    an actual command. In fact, if you were to enter only the PowerShell 
    Provider name and the two colons (filesystem::), PowerShell would crash.

    The pathname identifies the PowerShell Provider (filesystem::), the 
    PowerShell drive (c:), the container and subcontainer (\windows\system32), 
    and the item (\shell.dll), all of which are part of the FileSystem 
    namespace.

    Because all PowerShell Providers are associated with one or more 
    PowerShell drives, all namespaces contain one or more drives. In 
    addition, all drive names are unique across all PowerShell Providers, 
    and each drive is associated with only one provider. As a result, when 
    you set the current working location in PowerShell, you're also setting 
    the current namespace.
