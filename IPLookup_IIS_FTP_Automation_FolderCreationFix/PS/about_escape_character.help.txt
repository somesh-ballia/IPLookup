SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Change how the Windows PowerShell interprets a character

LONG DESCRIPTION

    The grave-accent(`) character has special meaning in Windows PowerShell:
    
    *   It indicates that the following character should be passed to the 
        command without substitution. 
    *   When used in a script at the end of a line (that is, with no 
        other characters following it), it instructs the PowerShell to 
        continue reading the command line from the next line.
    *   When used inside quotation marks, it indicates that the following 
        character should be interpreted as a special character. For 
        example, `n is a "new line" character that causes the PowerShell 
        to start a new line at the character, and `t is a tab 
        character that aligns the next character to the left of the next 
        column, which, by default, is eight characters wide.
        
    The following are the special characters recognized by the Windows 
    PowerShell:
    
    `'    Single quote
    `"    Double quote
    `0    Null
    `a    Alert
    `b    Backspace
    `f    Form feed
    `n    New line
    `r    Carriage return
    `t    Horizontal tab
    `v    Vertical tab
    
    EXAMPLES
    
        C:\> Write-Host "backup`b`bout"
        backout
        
        C:\>Write-Host "Break the line `nhere"
        Break the line
        Here
        
        C:\> Write-Host "Hi, `"Jim`""
        Hi, "Jim"
        
        C:\> Write-Host "12345678123456781`nCol1`tColumn2`tCol3"
        12345678123456781
        Col1    Column2 Col3
    
    In a script named test.ps1:
    
        Write-Host `
        "This shows the line continuation character."
        
        c:\>test.ps1
        This shows the line continuation character.
